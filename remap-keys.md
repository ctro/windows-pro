# Remap keys in Windows 10

Lots of things don't work. I tried them all.
Here's what does work:

1. Download and install [Windows server 2003 resource kit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=17657)
2. Srsly
3. Run `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\remapkey.exe` _as Administrator_
4. Drag from top to bottom to remap
5. Save
6. $$$
